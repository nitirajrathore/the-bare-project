## UI / UX
### 1
```
create a modern, concise UX design for chrome plugin settings page. In this setting one can add multiple conditional coloring for set of selected metrics.
we can select a metric and add conditional coloring to it based on its value. Like If I select "Market Capitalization" then I should be able to select conditions like value < 1000 -- Make color red, if color between 1000 - 5000 make color green, if color > 5000 make color blue. Similarly I should be able to select another metric and add different colors as per condition to that as well.
Make it look modern looking, and beautiful, also, when a metric is set the form should disappear and the summary of conditions and coloring should be shown in concise. Use smaller form factor instead of big, beacuse there will lots of metric conditions which will take a lot of space if form fields are big.

UI/ UX of conditional color selector like in google sheets for metrics values but more modern looking and concise. User should be able to select a metrics and specify operators like < > <= >= == and range (min - max) for comparing its value and a color selector for each condition. Once all conditions of a metrices value are specified, its form should be convert to summary line with which correctly represent the selection and condition in short. This summary when clicked should expand to the form again.
Multiple such metrices conditions can be specified in the settings page.
